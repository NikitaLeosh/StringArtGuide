# StringArtGuide
This program is intended to guide user's steps while creating string art pictures with nails by perimeter located on certain distance from each other. For the moment of first upload it's ready only for first few steps. It can convert input image into grayscale image with 10 shades of gray and save every grade into \current location of 'exe'\ShadesOfGray directory.
The next step will be to implement fields for rectangular or round shape of future picture. Then user's string will be guided to cross each othed amid the field and thus highlight current shade of gray. Layering over the top of each other they will create full image.
